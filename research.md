My research is focused on developing comprehensive, multi-scale models of cells – from their molecular underpinnings, 
to their integrated functions, to the organismic level with many heterogeneous cells interacting in a shared environment. 
The last two decades of biological research have generated abundant experimental data on the molecular composition, 
spatial organization, and dynamics of thousands of cell types; however, we need new tools that can transform this data 
into predictive models that can be used for scientific discovery. Rather than building isolated models that capture a 
narrow range of cellular behavior with a single class of representation, the next generation of computational models 
will need to combine *multi-source* and *multi-level* data with diverse, meaningful representations of biological 
mechanisms into integrative multi-scale simulations. These simulations will be used to interpret the input datasets, 
make experimental predictions, identify medical solutions, and help us understand fundamental principles of biological 
organization.

**The big picture – integrative models of cellular systems at multiple scales.**
(A) Microbial cells are compartments of active molecular processes. One level down – molecules have structures and 
dynamics, driven by fluxes of matter and energy. One level up – cells are embedded in environments with chemical 
gradients, other cells, and other species including host cells. Within this environment they exchange signals, compete 
for resources, and cooperate. Over extended periods of time, populations of cells develop and evolve. (B) Vivarium is 
an open-source software for combining models of diverse cellular functions by wiring them together across a hierarchy 
of nested compartments. I led the development of this software to make it increasingly easy to curate new models and 
multi-omics data. (C) Cartoon of a proposed multi-scale microbiome model, showing a model hierarchy 
as nested compartments. I plan to combine datasets on the microbiome and the cells that constitute it with models of 
diverse mechanisms such as signaling, metabolism, and transport. The model will be built incrementally by adding data 
and models of different biological functions. Its simulation will be used to shed light on the underlying complex 
interactions that give rise to microbiomes.
