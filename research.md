My research is focused on developing comprehensive, multi-scale models of cells â€“ from their molecular underpinnings, 
to their integrated functions, to the organismic level with many heterogeneous cells interacting in a shared environment. 
The last two decades of biological research have generated abundant experimental data on the molecular composition, 
spatial organization, and dynamics of thousands of cell types; however, we need new tools that can transform this data 
into predictive models that can be used for scientific discovery. Rather than building isolated models that capture a 
narrow range of cellular behavior with a single class of representation, the next generation of computational models 
will need to combine *multi-source* and *multi-level* data with diverse, meaningful representations of biological 
mechanisms into integrative multi-scale simulations. These simulations will be used to interpret the input datasets, 
make experimental predictions, identify medical solutions, and help us understand fundamental principles of biological 
organization.
