## Research

I am interested in the organization of living cells – what makes certain physical systems alive? What factors determine cells types and the transitions between them? How do cells divide? How do they develop? And how do they ultimately die? 

To answer these questions, it is advisable to start small by modeling minimal cells, understanding them fully, and then incrementally expanding the models to capture organisms of increased complexity. Developing successful models is only half of the process – theoretical understanding comes from the analysis of these models and the generation of experimental predictions. To accomplish this, I employ analytical techniques of complex systems science, which include network theory, dynamical systems theory, and information theory.
