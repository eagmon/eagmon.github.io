#### Compositional Systems Biology 
<p>Our approach in compositional systems biology aims to build a scalable, open-ended framework for integrating data and submodels into comprehensive, multiscale models. This approach emphasizes the interfaces and interconnections between different subsystems, focusing on the following key requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Composition Framework</strong>: Establishing standardized interfaces and orchestration patterns for integrative multiscale simulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Composition Schema</strong>: Providing robust, consistent formats for data and model integration to ensure seamless communication and control flows.</li>
  <li><strong>Compositional Software</strong>: Developing an open-source ecosystem of modular software that adheres to the standardized schema, facilitating flexible addition, removal, and modification of components.</li>
  <li><strong>Biological Schema</strong>: Creating reusable definitions for systems such as cellular interfaces and molecular mechanisms, enabling detailed models of biological processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Collectives</strong>: Fostering collaboration among researchers to build and share knowledge through integrative multiscale models, enhancing data and model integration across scientific consortia.</li>
</ul>
<p>By emphasizing the composition of models, software, schemas, and research efforts, this framework facilitates the integration of diverse biological data and models, ensuring scalability and continuous improvement with new scientific contributions.</p>

#### Ocean Microbiome

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Our research in ocean microbiomes is centered on connecting genome-scale metabolic models of bacteria and plankton to biogeochemical models of the water column. This integration aims to quantify the impact of microbial activities on climate. Key aspects include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metabolic Modeling</strong>: Developing detailed models of microbial metabolism to understand the functional capabilities of ocean bacteria and plankton.</li>
      <li><strong>Biogeochemical Integration</strong>: Linking these metabolic models to biogeochemical cycles in the water column to assess nutrient and carbon fluxes.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate Impact</strong>: Quantifying how microbial processes influence global climate patterns through their roles in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This work is conducted in collaboration with the Center for Chemical Currencies of a Microbial Planet at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>

#### Gut Microbiome
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Our gut microbiome research, conducted by UConn PhD students and undergrads within the Agmon lab, focuses on creating a comprehensive spatial dynamical model of the human intestines. Key research areas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ecological Niches</strong>: Quantifying the various niches within the intestines and their unique microbial communities, and the spatially structured environment with flows driven by peristalsis.</li>
      <li><strong>Microbial Interactions</strong>: Exploring how different microbes interact and coexist, from molecular networks to whole-gut physiology, including interactions between microbes and host cells, such as mucus production by goblet cells.</li>
      <li><strong>Layered Complexity</strong>: Addressing the hierarchical complexity and diverse interactions within the gut microbiome.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Modeling</strong>: Beginning with stoichiometric modeling, adding multi-species interactions, and incorporating processes like digestion and absorption.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Omics Data Integration</strong>: Incorporating multi-omics data to build detailed spatial models of the gut environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to integrate diverse datasets and uncover the complex microbial interactions that influence gut health and disease.</p>

#### Virtual Tissue Framework
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Our virtual tissue research focuses on developing a general framework for virtual tissue simulations, especially gut epithelium and cells in the gut tissue. This framework supports a standard format and integrates various data types and simulation methods, allowing for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiscale Data Integration</strong>: Synthesizig high-dimensional biological data, from molnecular to organ scales, into cohesive and dynamic models.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Functional Models</strong>: Transforming static spatial maps into functional simulations by adding layers of dynamic biological mechanisms, such as mucus production and metabolic interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Applications</strong>: Facilitating research on interactions between tissue morphologies and bacterial communities, looking for factors of host-microbiome dynamics.</li>
    </ul>
