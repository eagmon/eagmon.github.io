        <strong>Amin Boroomand, Postdoc</strong><br/>
        Amin is a computational biologist at the Agmon lab. Awarded a fellowship from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, he studies metabolic interactions in marine microbiomes through multi-scale modeling to improve understanding of ocean carbon cycling. Amin received his Ph.D. in Quantitative and Systems Biology with a focus on complexity and agent-based modeling from the University of California, Merced. Beyond academia, Amin is passionate about science communication and entrepreneurship and has a penchant for stand-up comedy.

## The Vivarium lab is hiring! Contact Eran Agmon at [agmon@uchc.edu](mailto:agmon@uchc.edu) for details.  

### Graduate Researcher
- We are looking for a graduate student interested in computational modeling of microbiomes -- this could include ocean 
microbiomes, soil microbiomes, and human gut microbiomes.
- This position requires admission into UConn Health's Biomedical Sciences PhD program, or Biomedical Engineering Program.

### Postdoctoral Researcher
- We are looking for a passionate scientist that will build integrative multiscale models of cellular systems, expand 
the Vivarium ecosystem, and publish research articles. This will involve working on one or more projects in whole-cell 
modeling (primarily E. coli), community structure in microbiomes, the design of synthetic cells, or the origins of life. 
- Requirements:
    - PhD in Computational Biology, Bioengineering, Complex Systems, Physics, Computer Science, or related field
    - Experience programming in Python
    - Motivated and collaborative personality
