        <strong>Eran Agmon, Principal Investigator</strong><br/>
        Eran is an Assistant Professor at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling at the University of Connecticut Health Center. 
        His research involves leveraging software methods to combine heterogeneous datasets and diverse modeling methods to generate integrative multi-scale simulations of cellular ecosystems that span molecular to multi-cellular and ecological scales.
        When he’s not immersed in science, you might find him reading or <a href="https://eagmon.github.io/art/" target="_blank">painting</a>.

    <div class="person-info">
        <strong>Tasnif Rahman, Postdoc</strong><br/>
Tasnif is working on spatial models of bacterial communities and their interactions with host tissues. 
His PhD at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute involved creating multicellular mechanical models to study symmetry breaking in tissue and organ morphogenesis. He looks forward to developing his computational skills is excited about revisiting his expertise in bacteriology developed during his undergraduate studies in Microbiology. 
Outside of the lab, Tasnif enjoys videogames, basketball and dance music!

    <div class="person-info">
        <strong>Edwin Appiah, PhD Student (Biomedical Sciences)</strong><br/>
Edwin is working on integrating consumer resource models with genome-scale metabolic models to build community simulations. 
Before joining UConn, as a student in Biodata Analytics and Computational Genomics (KNUST, Ghana), Edwin studied how the gastric microbiome influences gastric carcinogenesis focusing on bacterial diversity, co-occurrence pattern and predictive models. 
In his free time, Edwin enjoys playing or watching soccer.

    <div class="person-info">
        <strong>Maya Abdalla, PhD Student (Biomedical Sciences)</strong><br/>
Maya is currently working on integrating extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and, eventually, a biofilm model into the Whole Cell Model in Vivarium. 
Prior to joining UConn, Maya worked as a research assistant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where she managed and analyzed CT scans and data from participants in the Framingham Heart Study. 
She previously participated in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Summer Program in Biostatistics and Computational Biology. 
She aims to further develop her computational expertise and advance integrative biological modeling efforts.

    <div class="person-info">
        <strong>Neyamat Khan Tanvir, PhD Student (Biomedical Sciences)</strong><br/>
Tanvir is currently working on sRNA (small RNA) regulation in response to different kinds of stress into the Whole-Cell Model of E. coli using Vivarium. 
His work aims to integrate immunological perspectives into Whole-Cell Models to better capture host-pathogen dynamics. 
Prior to joining UConn Health, he conducted whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of Citrobacter werkmanii. 
He aspires to build robust computational models that bridge molecular mechanisms and cellular behaviour, driving innovation in systems-level biological research.
