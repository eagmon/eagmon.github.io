        <strong>Amin Boroomand, Postdoc</strong><br/>
        Amin is a computational biologist at the Agmon lab. Awarded a fellowship from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, he studies metabolic interactions in marine microbiomes through multi-scale modeling to improve understanding of ocean carbon cycling. Amin received his Ph.D. in Quantitative and Systems Biology with a focus on complexity and agent-based modeling from the University of California, Merced. Beyond academia, Amin is passionate about science communication and entrepreneurship and has a penchant for stand-up comedy.

        <strong>Edwin Appiah, PhD Student (Biomedical Sciences)</strong><br/>
        Prior Education: Bsc. Agricultural Biotechnology (KNUST, Ghana), Mphil. Biodata Analytics and Computational Genomics (KNUST, Ghana)
Research interest: Edwin is a PhD student in Biomedical Science at UConn health. Before joining UConn, Edwin studied how the gastric microbiome influences gastric carcinogenesis focusing on bacterial diversity, co-occurrence pattern and predictive models, which heightened his research interest in microbiome and health. Currently, Edwin continues to explore his research interest in microbiome at the Agmon lab, with a focus on building multi-scale computational models for the gut microbiome. Edwin loves to play or watch soccer during his leisure time.

        <strong>Jayde Schlesener, Bridge-to-PhD student</strong><br/>
        Jayde is a C-CoMP research fellow and bridge-to-PhD student through Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute working at the Agmon lab. Here she hopes to gain research experience analyzing data from marine microbes and their involvement in the oceanic biological pump. She graduated with her B.S. in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry from the University of Kansas and worked in a freshwater ecology lab looking at biogeochemical processes in intermittent streams during her undergrad. Jayde has plans to attend graduate school following her research fellowship continuing her work on marine environments.
