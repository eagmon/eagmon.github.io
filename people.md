Eran Agmon is an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](
https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) at the University of Connecticut Health Center. He is the primary developer of [Vivarium](https://vivarium-collective.github.io) -- a software 
ecosystem for modular, multiscale modeling in computational biology. This tool aims to enable labs to connect their 
data, models, and simulators to build more comprehensive models of cells. Eran's research involves leveraging advanced 
software methods and combining multi-omics datasets with diverse modeling methods to generate multi-scale simulations. 
He is interested in applying these approaches to build simulations of cellular ecosystems that span molecular to 
multi-cellular and environmental scales.

The Vivarium lab is hiring! Contact Eran Agmon at [agmon@uchc.edu](mailto:agmon@uchc.edu) for further details.  

## Graduate Researcher
- We are looking for a graduate student interested in computational modeling of microbiomes -- this could include ocean 
microbiomes, soil microbiomes, and human gut microbiomes.
- This position requires admission into UConn Health's Biomedical Sciences PhD program, or Biomedical Engineering Program.


## Postdoctoral Researcher
- We are looking for a passionate scientist that will build integrative multiscale models of cellular systems, expand 
the [Vivarium ecosystem](https://vivarium-collective.github.io), and publish research articles. This will involve 
working on one or more projects in whole-cell modeling (primarily E. coli), community structure in microbiomes, the 
design of synthetic cells, or the origins of life. 

### Requirements:
- PhD in Computational Biology, Bioengineering, Complex Systems, Physics, Computer Science, or related field
- Experience programming in Python
- Motivated and collaborative personality
