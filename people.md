        <strong>Eran Agmon, Principal Investigator</strong><br/>
        Eran is an Assistant Professor at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling at the University of Connecticut Health Center. 
        His research involves leveraging software methods to combine heterogeneous datasets and diverse modeling methods to generate integrative multi-scale simulations of cellular ecosystems that span molecular to multi-cellular and ecological scales.
        When heâ€™s not immersed in science, you might find him reading or <a href="https://eagmon.github.io/art/" target="_blank">painting</a>.

        <strong>Tasnif Rahman, Postdoc</strong><br/>
        Tasnif is a postdoc working on developing multi-scale computational models of bacterial communities and their interactions with host tissues. His PhD training at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was in tissue engineering and computational biomechanics, and his thesis work involved creating multicellular mechanical models to study symmetry breaking in tissue and organ morphogenesis. He looks forward to developing his computational skills is excited about revisiting his expertise in bacteriology developed during his undergraduate studies in Microbiology. Outside of the lab, Tasnif enjoys videogames, basketball and dance music!

        <strong>Edwin Appiah, PhD Student (Biomedical Sciences)</strong><br/>
        Prior Education: Bsc. Agricultural Biotechnology (KNUST, Ghana), Mphil. Biodata Analytics and Computational Genomics (KNUST, Ghana)
Research interest: Edwin is a PhD student in Biomedical Science at UConn health. Before joining UConn, Edwin studied how the gastric microbiome influences gastric carcinogenesis focusing on bacterial diversity, co-occurrence pattern and predictive models, which heightened his research interest in microbiome and health. Currently, Edwin continues to explore his research interest in microbiome at the Agmon lab, with a focus on building multi-scale computational models for the gut microbiome. Edwin loves to play or watch soccer during his leisure time.
