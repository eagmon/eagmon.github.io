Eran Agmon is an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](
https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) and the [Department of Molecular Biology and Biophysics](
https://health.uconn.edu/molecular-biology-biophysics/) at the University of Connecticut Health Center. He is the
primary developer of the [Vivarium Collective](https://vivarium-collective.github.io) -- a software ecosystem for 
modular, multiscale modeling in computational biology. This tool aims to enable labs to connect their data, models, 
and simulators to build more comprehensive models of cells. Eran's research involves developing leveraging advanced 
software methods, and combining multi-omics datasets with diverse modeling methods to generate multi-scale 
simulations. He is applying these approaches to build mechanistic simulations of whole microbiomes that span molecular 
to multi-cellular scales.

### Prior affiliations
He was previously a postdoctoral scientist at Stanford University’s Department of Bioengineering as part of the 
[Covert Lab](https://www.covert.stanford.edu), a postdoc at Columbia University’s Department of Biological Sciences 
in the [Stockwell lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/StockwellLab/index/index.html), 
a visiting scholar in the [Program for Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.ias.edu/ids) 
at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a founding member of [YHouse](https://www.yhousenyc.org). 
He completed my PhD in Informatics (emphasis in complex systems) and Cognitive Science at Indiana University, 
where he worked with [Randy Beer](https://rdbeer.pages.iu.edu) as part of an NSF IGERT on the Dynamics of 
Brain-Body-Environment Systems in Behavior and Cognition.
