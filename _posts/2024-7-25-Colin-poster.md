title: Colin Slavin's summer internship
---

Colin is a HRP student from the UConn Storrs Biomedical Engineering Dept. For his summer internship, Colin developed
a PDE model of Peristalsis, and a reusable Vivarium process for simulating the affect of peristalsis on the spatial 
distributions of bacterial and nutrient in the gut. Great job, Colin! Looking forward to continuing this work with you.
