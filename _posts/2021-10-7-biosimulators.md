combine simulations @Vivarium. We're in the BioSimulators pipeline! 
[https://biosimulators.org](https://biosimulators.org) 

BioSimulators is a free registry of biosimulation tools, with a standardized interface. 
The simulators support a broad range of frameworks 
(e.g., logical, kinetic), simulation algorithms (e.g., FBA, SSA), 
and formats (e.g., BNGL, CellML, NeuroML/LEMS, SBML, Smoldyn).
And with Vivarium, they can now be combined.
