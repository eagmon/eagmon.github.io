title: Double-Scope Integration
---
As an undergrad at UCSD's Dept of Cognitive Science, I was deeply influenced by Gilles Fauconnier and am saddened to 
learn of his passing earlier this year. In revisting his landmark book, [The Way We Think](https://www.amazon.com/Way-We-Think-Conceptual-Complexities/dp/0465087868/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=gilles+fauconnier&qid=1634756235&sr=8-1),
I am excited to see just how much his notion of conceptual blending still resonates with my research. The figure below 
illustrates "double-scope integration", in which two input conceptual frames are brought together into a blended frame 
that can lead to novel insights. This is what I aim to systematize by developing integrative modeling tools that can 
combine input computational models of different aspects of a given biological system, and through their integration 
reveal novel biology.
