title: Vivarium-ecoli is now public
---

[Vivarium-ecoli](https://github.com/CovertLab/vivarium-ecoli) is the Covert lab's new version of the E. coli whole-cell
model, built entirely with the Vivarium framework. This combines over a dozen independent sub-models, which have been 
fitted with the Vivarium interface to make them into reusable modules â€“ these can now be recombined in alternate models, 
and will be a valuable resource for the modeling community and for future research. In addition to modularizing the
whole-cell model, we combined agent-based modeling to support running multiple heterogeneous E. coli models in parallel
within a shared environment. The result was a multiscale model that facilitates the study of emergent population-level 
behaviors with single-cell molecular resolution. Paper coming soon.
