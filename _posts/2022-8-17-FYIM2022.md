title: Find Your Inner Modeler
---

Eran is giving a talk at [Find Your Inner Modeler V (FYIM)](http://findingyourinnermodeler.org/projects/5) with [Matt Akamatsu](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/matthew-akamatsu) on their recent collaborations with the [Allen Institute for Cell Science](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/cell-science/).
FYIM is a collaborative project incubator for quantitative cell biologists and computational modelers.
This year, the theme of their annual conference was "Toward Whole Cell Models" -- a topic near and dear to Eran's heart.
