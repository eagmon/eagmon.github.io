title: Building the next generation of virtual cells
---

[Building the next generation of virtual cells to understand cellular biology](
https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(23)00236-9.pdf) is out in Biophysical Society Journal. In this paper, we
propose the development of dynamic 3D models that integrate various sources of data, to comprehensively understand 
cellular behaviors, bridge the gap between theory and experimental data, and foster interdisciplinary research 
collaborations. Very excited to work with this team to bring about the next generation of virtual cell models!
