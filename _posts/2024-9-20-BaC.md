title: Build-A-Cell

Today Eran returned to [Build-A-Cell](https://www.buildacell.org) after a couple years hiatus to lead
the in-silico cell working group. The goal of this working group is to develop a comprehensive model of a
minimal synthetic cell. We worked with Akshay Maheshwari of [b.next](https://bnext.bio) to integrate Vivarium
with their [Nucleus](https://nucleus.bnext.bio) platform for building real synthetic cells.
