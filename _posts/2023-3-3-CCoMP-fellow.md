---

I am honored to join the [C-CoMP team](https://ccomp-stc.org/about/c-comp-team/) as an inaugural faculty fellow!
The Center for Chemical Currencies of a Microbial Planet (C-CoMP) is an interdisciplinary collaboration to leverage 
advances in analytical and data sciences, incorporate ocean sampling technologies and an open-science framework, 
and engage educators and policy-makers to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the chemicals and microbial 
processes that underpin ocean ecosystems and other microbiomes.
