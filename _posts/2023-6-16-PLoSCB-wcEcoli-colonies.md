title: wcEcoli colonies paper is out on PLoS CB
---

The first paper on [vivarium-ecoli](https://github.com/CovertLab/vivarium-ecoli) is out! [*Whole-cell modeling 
of E. coli colonies enables quantification of single-cell heterogeneity in antibiotic responses*](
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011232) has been published in PLoS Computational
Biology. This project used Vivarium to reconstruct an existing [E. coli whole-cell model](
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aav3751), expand it with several new submodels, and nest it within a spatial
environment shared by many independent whole-cell E. coli models running in parallel. This effectively connects 
molecular-level events with colony-level phenonema. Perhaps the most multiscale model ever?
