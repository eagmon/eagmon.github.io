title: The Agmon Lab is Open
---

As of today, the Agmon Lab (also known as the Vivarium lab) is open in the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling.
Our research is twofold: 1) we are developing computational methods for combining multi-omics datasets and diverse 
models into multi-scale simulations, and 2) we are applying these approaches to build mechanistic simulations of 
whole cells and microbiomes, which span molecular to multi-cellular scales.
