I recently returned from the IMAG symposium conference, held June 28-29 at the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, MD. IMAG, 
the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group, is a collective of program officials from various U.S. federal agencies 
that supports research funding for modeling and analyzing biomedical, biological, and behavioral systems. Connecting 
with this community is immensely importance as it provides a platform for interacting with a large group of 
multiscale modelers in biology, fostering collaboration, knowledge exchange, and potential funding opportunities and 
partnerships. Notably, the prevalent use of hybrid simulation techniques at the conference underscored the relevance of 
Vivarium as a general framework for model integration. I presented this poster on Process Bigraphs.
