title: Center for Chemical Currencies of a Microbial Planet (C-CoMP)

[C-CoMP's](https://ccomp-stc.org) first All-Center Meeting took place October 17-20 2022 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution. It was a pleasure to attend for all of these days, during which I learned about all the different projects
taking place within the center. It was great to meet many collaborators in-person for the first time, and to brainstorm
the next phase of the center's research.
