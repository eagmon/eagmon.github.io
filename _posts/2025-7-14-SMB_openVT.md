title: Eran Agmon speaks at Society for Mathematical Biology
---

Eran participated in the 2025 [Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB) Annual Meeting](https://2025.smb.org/), where he contributed to two events showcasing multiscale tissue modeling approaches.

He gave a talk at the [OpenVT SMB Workshop: Compositional Modeling of Multicellular Systems](https://www.openvt.org/pages/events/workshops/2025openvt-smb-workshop.html), which brought together experts developing interoperable platforms for spatial and multiscale modeling. The workshop emphasized community standards and collaborative infrastructure for virtual tissue simulations.

Eran also spoke in the SMB Minisymposium on [Modeling Frameworks for Biological Multiscale Systems](https://2025.smb.org/MS01/MS-MFBM-14-Part-1.html), highlighting recent developments in compositional simulation and multicellular schemas.

These events reflect the growing interest in building scalable, composable frameworks for biological modeling, and Eranâ€™s contributions helped shape the conversation around the next generation of simulation tools.
