---

We are thrilled to welcome Ryan Spangler as our new University Director, joining to lead software development for the Vivarium framework and our next-generation E. coli whole-cell model. 
Ryan brings nearly 20 years of experience in research software engineering, with a career spanning major institutions at the forefront of systems biology. 
His recent positions include senior software development roles at Stanford University, The Allen Institute for Cell Science, and Altos Labsâ€™ Multiscale Modeling Group, where he helped develop tools for integrating biological data and simulations. 
At UConn, Ryan will oversee the engineering roadmap for Vivarium 2.0, expanding its capabilities for composable, multiscale biological modeling, with a focus on making whole-cell models accessible and reusable for the broader research community.
