title: Eran Agmon speaks at Space Biotechnology Workshop
---

Eran gave a talk on whole-cell modeling at the [Advancing Space Biotechnology through Whole-Cell Models and Functional Annotation Hybrid Workshop](https://community.apan.org/wg/afosr/w/researchareas/40885/advancing-space-biotechnology-through-whole-cell-models-and-functional-annotation-workshop/), hosted by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).

The event took place March 17â€“18, 2025, at the Basic Research Innovation Collaboration Center (BRICC) in Arlington, Virginia. The workshop brought together experts in computational biology, synthetic biology, space science, and bioinformatics to explore how predictive whole-cell models can accelerate biotechnology innovation in space.
Eran presented the lab's work on modular and multiscale simulations of microbial systems, and discussed how whole-cell models can be used to understand gene function and adaptation to space environments.
