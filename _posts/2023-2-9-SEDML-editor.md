Eran has been in voted as the next [SED-ML](https://sed-ml.org/index.html) editor. 
SED-ML, or Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language, is an standardized XML-based format developed to encode 
the settings and parameters of simulation experiments, facilitating their exchangeability and reproducibility. I 
intend to enhance SED-ML by improving its composability, enabling more complex and integrative simulation pipelines 
to be reliably configured and reproduced across different software platforms and environments.
