title: Arnab Mutsuddy joins the Agmon lab
---

We are excited to welcome Arnab Mutsuddy to the Agmon lab as a new postdoctoral researcher in whole-cell modeling! Arnab recently completed his PhD in Chemical Engineering from Clemson University, where he made significant contributions to the development of a modular and scalable pipeline for a large-scale mechanistic model of single cell proliferation and death signaling.

Welcome, Arnab! We look forward to your research on multi-scale computational models of E. coli and other microbes.
