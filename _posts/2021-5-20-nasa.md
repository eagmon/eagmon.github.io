title: Center for the Emergence of Life at NASA

I'm excited to join NASA's Center for the Emergence of Life as a research affiliate -- 
[see here](https://www.nasa.gov/center-for-the-emergence-of-life/people).
I've been working on a project with Gabrielle Cohn, Andrew Pohorille, Milena Popovic, and 
Mark Ditzler to use machine learning to characterize RNA function from sequence and structure. 
The results promise to reveal the fitness landscape and evolution of early life in the RNA world.
