title: DARPA-ASKEM kickoff
---

The [DARPA Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM)](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-12-06) program is kicking off this week. 
ASKEMâ€™s overall goal is to develop tools for agile creation and maintenance of complex models and simulators, to support decision making in diverse mission and scientific domains. 

Eran is a Principal Investigator for ASKEM, as part of the Causal Inference Engine for Multiscale Simulations (CIEMSS) team.
CIEMSS is developing software tools for answering prognostic and diagnostic questions about complex multi-scale/multi-model scenarios. 
This includes a simulation-based inference engine that converts models into probabilistic programs in order to answer causal queries, and multi-fidelity inference algorithms for running ensembles of models at different levels of fidelity.
