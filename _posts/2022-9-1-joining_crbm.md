title: Joining the Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling
---

Eran has joined the [Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling (CRBM)](https://reproduciblebiomodels.org) as an investigator in Technology Research and Development for Online Simulation.
The long-term goal of CRBM is to achieve comprehensive predictive models of biological systems, such as whole-cell models, which can guide precision medicine and synthetic biology. 
Toward this long-term goal, the center is making models understandable, reproducible, reusable, and composable by (1) developing model building, annotation, and simulation tools and (2) combining these and other existing tools into a user-friendly reproducible modeling workflow.
