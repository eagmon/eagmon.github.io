## Postdoctoral Researcher

### Workplace:
- The Agmon Lab is a new research laboratory at UConn Health’s Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling. We are developing 
multi-scale whole-cell models that span from molecular underpinnings, to integrated functions, to multi-cell 
interactions in an environment. This requires the development of new computational methods that combine multi-source 
and multi-level data with models of diverse biological mechanisms, and execute these as integrative simulations. To 
support this vision, we are building [Vivarium](https://vivarium-collective.github.io) – an open-source ecosystem of 
modular biological models. We have several ongoing collaborations that apply Vivarium in the domains of single cell 
bacterial physiology (primarily E. coli), community interactions in microbiomes (both ocean microbiomes and gut 
microbiomes), synthetic cells, and the origins of life.

### Job Description:
- We are looking for a passionate scientist that will build complex multi-scale models of cellular systems, and expand 
the Vivarium ecosystem. This will involve working on one or more projects in single cell bacterial physiology, 
microbiomes, synthetic cells, or the origins of life. 

### Requirements:
- PhD in Computational Biology, Bioengineering, Complex Systems, Physics, Computer Science, or related field
- Experience programming in Python
- Motivated and collaborative personality

### Responsibilities:
- Build robust open-source models and use them to study cellular systems of interest
- Work with collaborators to integrate their experimental data or models into fully functional multi-scale simulations
- Publish research papers

### Benefits:
- Benefits: Medical and dental insurance
- Opportunities to work with researchers across several existing collaborations, and to contribute to an exciting new 
field of science
- Flexible work schedule
- Remote work options

### Availability: 
- This position is available immediately and open until filled. Contact Eran Agmon at 
[agmon@uchc.edu](mailto:agmon@uchc.edu) for further details.
