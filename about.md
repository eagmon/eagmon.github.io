I am a postdoctoral scientist at Stanford University’s Department of Bioengineering, where I develop whole-cell models 
of *E. coli* as part of the [Covert Lab](https://www.covert.stanford.edu). 
I was previously a postdoc at Columbia University’s Department of Biological Sciences in the 
[Stockwell lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/StockwellLab/index/index.html), 
a visiting scholar in the [Program for Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.ias.edu/ids) 
at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a founding member of [YHouse](https://www.yhousenyc.org). 
I completed my PhD in Informatics (emphasis in complex systems) and Cognitive Science at Indiana University, 
where I worked with [Randy Beer](https://rdbeer.pages.iu.edu). 
There, my research was funded by an NSF IGERT on the Dynamics of Brain-Body-Environment Systems in Behavior and Cognition.

My research involves combining computational modeling methods and machine learning to map and interpret complex 
biological data, automate the construction of models in computational biology, and speed up the rate of 
scientific progress in the field of cellular biology. Within that domain, my work has focused on whole cells, 
metabolism, lipid membranes, and neural systems. I am interested in quantifying and controlling the viability of 
organisms – whether it is in cell development and death, in adaptation, in medicine, or at the origins of life.
