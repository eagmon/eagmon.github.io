I am a postdoctoral scientist at Stanford University’s Department of Bioengineering, where I develop whole-cell models 
of *E. coli* as part of the Covert Lab. I was previously a postdoc at Columbia University’s Department of Biological 
Sciences in the Stockwell lab, a visiting scholar in the Program for Interdisciplinary Studies at The Institute for 
Advanced Study in Princeton, and a founding member of YHouse. I completed my PhD in Informatics (emphasis in complex 
systems) and Cognitive Science at Indiana University, where I worked with Randy Beer. There, my research was funded by 
an NSF IGERT on the Dynamics of Brain-Body-Environment Systems in Behavior and Cognition.

I am interested in applying machine learning to map and interpret complex biological data, automate the construction of 
models in computational biology, and speed up the rate of scientific discovery. Within that domain, my work has focused 
on whole cells, metabolism, lipid membranes, and neural systems. I am interested in quantifying and controlling the 
viability of organisms – whether it is in cell development and death, in adaptation, in medicine, or in the origins of 
life.
