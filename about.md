Eran Agmon is an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](
https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) and the [Department of Molecular Biology and Biophysics](
https://health.uconn.edu/molecular-biology-biophysics/) at the University of Connecticut Health Center. 
His research involves developing computational methods for combining multi-omics datasets and diverse models 
into multi-scale simulations. He is applying these approaches to build mechanistic simulations of whole microbiomes, 
which span molecular to multi-cellular scales.
 
### Prior affiliations
He was previously a postdoctoral scientist at Stanford University’s Department of Bioengineering as part of the 
[Covert Lab](https://www.covert.stanford.edu), a postdoc at Columbia University’s Department of Biological Sciences 
in the [Stockwell lab](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/StockwellLab/index/index.html), 
a visiting scholar in the [Program for Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.ias.edu/ids) 
at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a founding member of [YHouse](https://www.yhousenyc.org). 
He completed my PhD in Informatics (emphasis in complex systems) and Cognitive Science at Indiana University, 
where he worked with [Randy Beer](https://rdbeer.pages.iu.edu) as part of an NSF IGERT on the Dynamics of 
Brain-Body-Environment Systems in Behavior and Cognition.
