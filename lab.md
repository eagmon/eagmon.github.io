Eran Agmon is an Assistant Professor at the [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](
https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/) at the University of Connecticut Health Center. He is the primary developer of [Vivarium](https://vivarium-collective.github.io) -- a software 
ecosystem for modular, multiscale modeling in computational biology. This tool aims to enable labs to connect their 
data, models, and simulators to build more comprehensive models of cells. Eran's research involves leveraging advanced 
software methods and combining multi-omics datasets with diverse modeling methods to generate multi-scale simulations. 
He is interested in applying these approaches to build simulations of cellular ecosystems that span molecular to 
multi-cellular and environmental scales.
